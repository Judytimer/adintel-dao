# Problem Statement - AdIntel DAO

## The Unjust Reality of Data Monopoly

### Current Pain Points

- ðŸ”’ **Data Ownership Misalignment**: Facebook and Google generate hundreds of billions in annual revenue from advertising data, while users who create this data receive nothing in return
- ðŸ“Š **Information Asymmetry**: Major platforms monopolize market insights, forcing small businesses to advertise blindly
- ðŸ’¸ **Price Barriers**: Professional ad intelligence tools (SpyFu, SEMrush) charge $150+ monthly, putting them out of reach for small businesses

## The Core Insight

The advertising industry generates over $600 billion annually, yet the data that powers it is controlled by a handful of platforms. This creates a fundamental market inefficiency:

1. **Advertisers** pay premium prices for limited insights
2. **Users** generate valuable behavioral data but receive no compensation
3. **Platforms** capture all the value while limiting data access

AdIntel DAO breaks this monopoly by creating a three-sided marketplace where:
- Users are rewarded for contributing public ad data
- Advertisers get affordable, comprehensive market intelligence
- The community owns and governs the data collectively

This isn't just about building a better tool â€“ it's about restructuring the fundamental economics of digital advertising data.
